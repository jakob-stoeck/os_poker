A simple HTTP server to serve os_poker long poll HTTP requests.

When served by a traditional LAMP stack, a new PHP context is created for each
long-poll request and stay in memory while waiting for events. This cause major
memory consumption.

The simple single-threaded server is designed to serve these requests. It polls
the os_poker database once every 3 seconds to retrieve message to be returned
in multiple responses.
