 * Poker 4.3 specification test case: Forgot Password workflow
 *
 * @Note: According to irc convo, this step will use Drupal's password recovery
 * workflow, so there is nothing to test in this section:
 *
 * <ilo--> because the password recovery workflow is very different in specs
 * <ilo--> and it is already tested by drupal test suite
 * <ilo--> so.. I don't see a way to define a test not done already, being 'not
 *      too much deviated' from specs, but having a completely different
 *      workflow
 * <dachary> ah
 * <dachary> I suppose we can say it's done the drupal way...
 * <dachary> (sent a mail asking for a change on 4.3, thanks)
