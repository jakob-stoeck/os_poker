/**
 * Helpers for spec. 4.4: Workflow "Invite friends" test case
 *
 * Functionality testing for the SMTP setup. Invite friends workflow requires an
 * email to be sent by the SMTP server. Verifies that Drupal emails are being
 * sent through PHP smtp server library (depends on php.ini settings). The test
 * just verifies PHP mail() function, if other library is in use the test should
 * be configured for that.
 *
 * The email verification is done reading the file /var/spool/mail/$www-user,
 * where $www-user may depend on the system configuration.
 *
 * @assert:  submit email to valid existing address produces no error
 * @assert:  submit email to invalid existing address produces error ? not sure.
