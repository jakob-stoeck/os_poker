		<ul class="helpbox-list">

		<ul class="helpbox-list">
			<li>using this Website to transmit material PW believe to be obscene or illegal;</li>
			<li>forging message headers or identity information, or taking any action  with the intent of bypassing restrictions or limits on access to a  specific service or Website. This prohibition does not restrict the  legitimate non-commercial use of pseudonymous or anonymous services; and</li>

		</ul>

		<h5>Security</h5>
		<p>You must configure your system in a  secure manner. Should your system be exploited by unauthorized persons,  you are responsible for both reporting the violation (where  applicable), and fixing the exploited system. For instance, should the  security of a mail server be compromised to distribute unsolicited  emails, you are responsible for immediately re-configuring the system  to prevent further unauthorized use. You are prohibited from  interfering or attempting to interfere with services (also referred to  as Denial of Service Attacks), whether intentionally or through  neglect, of any other user, host, or network. The prevention of  "unintentional attacks", such as infection and subsequent propagation  of computer viruses, is your responsibility. Anti-virus software should  be installed on every system which connects to the website. </p>

			<li>altering or faking e-mail header information to misdirect or otherwise  "spoof" another party for the purpose of evading detection or any other  purposes; and</li>
			<li>configuring any e-mail server in such a way that it will accept third  party e-mails for forwarding (commonly known as an "open mail relay").  If a Website has roaming users who wish to use a common mail server,  the mail server must be configured to require some form of user  identification and authorization.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Users that send mass or commercial e-mail are required to maintain  complete and accurate records of all e-mail activity for a reasonable  time, and to immediately provide PW with such records upon request of  PW. This may include requests for database verification of a contact's  removal. </p>

		<p>In addition to the  prohibitions against Spam as detaily, privacy practices or other policies of or contained in the  Third Party Websites or the Third Party Applications, Software or  Content.
